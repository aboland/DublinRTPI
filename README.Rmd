Real-time Passenger Information for Dublin city's public transport.  


Code to retrieve real time information about Dublin Bus and Dart services. Allows the aggregation of multiple bus stops.  
**No Luas info currently.**


***

## Shiny App

The code located in [ShinyApp](/ShinyApp) is an interactive app which will retrieve and display information about the bus and train services in Dublin.  

A live version of the app should be running at [https://aboland.shinyapps.io/DublinTransport/](https://aboland.shinyapps.io/DublinTransport/)

#### Custom URL

A custom url can be used to pre-load the application with your choices of stops and buses. This can be bookmarked to save time.  
Example: [http://aboland.shinyapps.io:/DublinTransport/?stops=334,336&routes=14,140](http://aboland.shinyapps.io:/DublinTransport/?stops=334,336&routes=14,140)

### Run Locally

The Shiny app can be run locally from within R or R Studio. *The [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) library must be installed.*  

```r
# install.packages("shiny")
shiny::runGitHub("aboland/DublinRTPI", subdir = "ShinyApp")
```  

#### Other Dependencies

The app also relies on the following packages, [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [`stringr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html), [`XML`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html), and [`rvest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/).

## R Package

The code located in [Rlib](/Rlib) contains an R package named `dublinRTPI`. This can be installed using the `devtools` package.  

The package contains functions to retrieve live info for Dart and Dublin Bus. A light version of the main shiny app is also included in the package.

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aboland/DublinRTPI", subdir = "Rlib")

 # Get info about bus stop number 334
dublinRTPI::db_info(334)

 # Run shiny app
dublinRTPI::runShiny()
```
